SELECT status FROM tasks ORDER BY status;

2)
SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.name) 
FROM tasks INNER JOIN projects ON projects.id = tasks.project_id 
GROUP BY projects.id 
ORDER BY COUNT(tasks.name) DESC;

3)
SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.name) 
FROM tasks INNER JOIN projects ON projects.id = tasks.project_id

6)
SELECT name FROM tasks GROUP BY name HAVING count(*)>1;

8) Примерно похож
SELECT DISTINCT projects.name, COUNT(tasks.status = 'Off') AS quantity
FROM tasks INNER JOIN projects ON projects.id = tasks.project_id
WHERE tasks.status = 'Off'
GROUP BY projects.id;
